# MandelbrotFractalViewer

A viewer of the fractal known as the [Mandelbrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set).

In addition to the classic Mandelbrot Set it can also generate the Multibrot Sets (the generalization of the Mandelbrot to different exponents)

The image generator is testMandelbrot.m, the image size, zoom, iterations, threshold and coordinates of the fractal can be changed.

The file framesGenerator.m generates frames for videos to display changes in zoom, iterations, threshold, coordinates and the degree of the recursive function.

Some results can be seen [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/C0Lyx1Eu1j0/)
